## 🧬 About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow at ISTA, Austria, working on **binary evolution**, **stellar structure**, and **supernova–CSM interaction**.  
My work combines **theoretical modelling** and **numerical simulations** to explore the evolution and explosion of massive stars.

I received my Ph.D. in China and joined ISTA in 2024 with the support of the **CSC–DAAD Postdoctoral Fellowship**.  
I am deeply interested in understanding how massive binary stars evolve and how their explosions shape the universe.
