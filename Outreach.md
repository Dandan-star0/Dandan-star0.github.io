# Outreach & Public Engagement

<div class="outreach-intro">
  <p>
    I am passionate about bringing astrophysics and stellar-evolution research to the broader public.  
    One of our flagship activities is the board game <strong>“Habitable”</strong>, developed at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) to engage families, students and game-enthusiasts in the science of planetary habitability.

## 🧩 My Role & Contributions

- Conceptualised key scientific mechanisms for the game, linking stellar evolution, binary interactions and habitability.  
- Co-led public test events in Heidelberg with schools and outreach centres.  
- Helped translate game mechanics into accessible topics for non‐specialists while retaining research authenticity.
