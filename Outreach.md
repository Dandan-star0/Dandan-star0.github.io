# Outreach & Public Engagement

<div class="outreach-intro">
  <p>
    We am passionate about bringing astrophysics and stellar-evolution research to the broader public.  
    One of our flagship activities is the board game <strong>“Habitable”</strong>, developed at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) to engage families, students and game-enthusiasts in the science of planetary habitability.
