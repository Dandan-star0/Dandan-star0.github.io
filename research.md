# ðŸ”­ Research Overview

My research focuses on the **evolution and explosion of massive binary stars**.  
Through a combination of analytic theory, numerical simulation, and stellar population modelling, I explore how binary interactions shape the fates of massive stars and produce diverse transients and compact objects.

### Massive Binary Evolution
I investigate how binary mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and orbital dynamics lead to the formation of **gravitational-wave progenitors** and **stripped-envelope supernovae**.

---

### Core-Collapse Supernovae
I model **shock propagation and light curve evolution** of core-collapse SNe interacting with circumstellar material (CSM), using both analytic and numerical methods.

---

### Multiple Populations in Globular Clusters
I explore how binary interactions and stellar feedback contribute to the observed **chemical and photometric anomalies** in multiple stellar populations of globular clusters.
